# Police Fine Management - SQL Database & Queries

This project dives into creating and querying a SQL database, focusing on the management of police fines and payments. It was a hands-on exercise to learn more about database setup and extracting valuable insights through queries.

## Project Breakdown
- Database Creation: Started with creating tables to store personal details, violation types, and report data.
- Data Population: Next, I populated these tables with realistic data to simulate the workings of a police department handling fines.
- Query Execution: The core of this project was running various SQL queries to analyze the data.
 Key queries included:
  - Counting Reports: Determining the total number of reports to understand the volume of fines processed.
  - Points Deduction Analysis: Calculating the total points deducted from drivers, giving insight into the severity of violations.
  - Grouping by Violation Type: Aggregating reports by type of violation to see common trends in fines.
  - Fine Details for Residents: Extracting detailed records for specific demographics, such as all fines for residents of a particular city.
  - Time-Specific Queries: Looking at fines within specific time frames, such as violations recorded between two dates, to observe patterns or spikes in violations.
